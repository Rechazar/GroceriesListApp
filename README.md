# Grocery List App

The App is designed to be used for list creation, shared between people online or used in offline for single person use.

Current things that need to be dealt with:

- App does not actually email out a registration notification. This is purely to have an account and collaborate with another.

- When adding an item to a list, the "Share this List" button currently appears while offline, likely will crash application.

- If you try to login with incorrect details the app will crash, fix this problem asap as people have fast fingers.

- Keyboard does not stay up when adding items to a list. This is likely going to bother many, need to fix this.

- Registration takes time before successful message popups.

- Password is not hidden. Have a button to show/hide this.

- Needs a way to reset password.
